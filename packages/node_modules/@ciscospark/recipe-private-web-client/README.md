# @ciscospark/recipe-private-web-client

See https://ciscospark.github.io/spark-js-sdk/

This is a plugin recipe for the Cisco Spark JavaScript SDK. This recipe uses internal APIs to provide the features needed by the Cisco Spark Web Client. There is no guarantee of non-breaking changes. Non-Cisco engineers should stick to the `ciscospark` package.

## Usage

```javascript
let spark
try {
  // Normal operation
  CiscoSpark = require(`@ciscospark/recipe-private-web-client`).default;
}
catch {
  // Development mode
  CiscoSpark = require(`spark-js-sdk/recipe-private-web-client`).default;
}

const spark = new CiscoSpark({
  config: ...
});
```

### Development

This package cannot be directly npm linked. When developing against it, use the try/catch block above to link against the root sdk directory. You'll need to run `npm run build` manually in the sdk root and, of course, you'll need to rebuild to get your changes to be detected. (Through some future babel, browserify, or webpack magic, we'll rig it up so that manual rebuild is not necessary).
